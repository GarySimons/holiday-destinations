The project is aimed toward holiday-makers and also families of all ages. The website needs to be visually appealing enough to encourage user interaction whilst also providing an good User Experience to entise shoppers to use our service.

* Navigation takes user to specific parts of the website.
* Pop out nav appears in place of navbar on Tablet + Mobile Devices.

### Design Choices:

The theme of this project is holidays and vacations, therefore my design choices are heavily influenced by positive colours and motifs. https://www.crazyegg.com/blog/colors-proven-to-boost-sales/ Using the resources in this blog I was able to pick out a colour scheme that has been proven to boost sales/interaction with a web page.

##### Fonts: 
I chose to use the font LATO as it showcases a very simplistic style which compliments the minimalist nature of the overall site design. The focus of the content is to provide an informative experience for the customer, which heavily influenced my decision to choose a font that isn't too ambiguous.

##### Icons: 
The icons used are self explanatory so that the user does not need to struggle to interpret what the icon will actually do.

##### Colours:
Using learned knowledge from prior research, bright and vibrant colours have a higher influence in terms of positivity and therefore more potential sales/leads and interactions: Using https://coolors.co/d9f0ff-5bc0eb-e55934-fa7921-fde74c i was able to find a colour scheme that suited the afor mentioned points.

Primary: #5BC0EB “Blue Jeans” I chose this as the primary colour as the colour blue is great to influence thoughts of trust, honesty and intelligence.

Secondary: #FA7921 “Princeton Orange” I chose this as the secondary colour as this colour provides an eye catching contrast to blue as well as having the added benefit of triggering optimistic emotions.

Tertiary: #FDE74C “Gargoyle Gas” Finally this tertiary colour will be used as an accent highlight on certain elements, this colour promoted happiness among the average person and therefore (hopefully) influence more sales/leads.

##### Styling: 

Thanks to SASS/SCSS I was easily able to set variables in my stylesheets that ask as the house style - this means that the styles can be used in multiple places without having to repeat code. 

Example Variables:

$primary-color: #5BC0EB; 
$secondary-color: #FA7921;
$default-link-color: #FDE74C;
 
$default-text-shadow: 1px 1px #000;
$default-transition: all 0.2s ease-in-out;
$default-box-shadow: 1px 1px 1px rgba(0,0,0,0.4);

##### Background:
The background images I chose to use on the banner are sourced from royalty free websites, they showcase different types of ‘lifestyle’ shots on different holiday destinations. Arguably large images like the ones mentioned are great for encouraging sales and leads.
